## Questions and Answers

### Why are there no shell scripts or Makefiles?

Everything is written in Go, including scripts. Introducing another language adds platform dependency and complexity. Go scripts are portable, reliable, and readable.

The `scripts/` directory contains all project scripts. Build with:

```bash
cd scripts && go run . build
```

Go's build cache makes incremental builds fast. No Makefile is needed.

### Can I use library X?

No. This project avoids third-party dependencies to prevent dependency hell. Use only the Go standard library.
